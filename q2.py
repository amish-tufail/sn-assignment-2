# Pseudo-code:
# 1. We need to read each CSV file from the "temperature_data" folder for each year.
#    - For each file, extract temperature data for each month (January to December).
#    - If a file is missing or cannot be read, handle the error and prompt to continue.
# 2. Calculate average temperatures for each season (Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring):
#    - For each season, calculate the average temperature across all years.
# 3. Find the station with the largest temperature range:
#    - For each station, calculate the temperature range (difference between max and min temperature).
# 4. Find the warmest and coolest stations based on the highest and lowest temperatures.
# 5. Save the results in separate files:
#    - "average_temp.txt" for the average temperatures for each season.
#    - "largest_temp_range_station.txt" for the station with the largest temperature range.
#    - "warmest_and_coolest_station.txt" for the warmest and coolest stations.
